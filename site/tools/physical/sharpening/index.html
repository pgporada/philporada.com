    <li>To help you see the bevel while beginning to sharpen a hunting knife, you can glide a sharpie or felt tip marker over the bevel. This will show you were to ride the whetstone.</li>
    <li>Always start sharpening behind the edge</li>
    <li>It's reccomended to keep the primary bevel that was originally on the knife. 21 degrees is a good all around angle for hunting knives. It's the perfect compromise between a low and strong angle.</li>
    <li>Use the pressure from the weight of your arm aka light pressure till you feel the stone sliding.</li>
    <li>Add more pressure until you can feel and hear the stone start to cut. This is the perfect pressure.</li>
    <li>When the two sides of the blade come to angle, a burr develops.</li>

    <li>Diamond stones should only be ceramic or carbide steel because those materials are very hard.</li>
    <li>Diamond stones are never to be used on regular steel. The diamond crystalline structure sinks into the steel and pulls the diamonds off their plate. This information was provided by Ben Dale of Edge Pro Knife Sharpeners.</li>
    <li>Always finish sharpening a blade by running it counter to a piece of leather. This is called stropping.</li>
